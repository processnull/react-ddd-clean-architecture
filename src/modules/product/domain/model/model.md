Model represents a group of entities. This is true in the general case. However, in the specific case of the product domain, a model can also be an extension of an entity.

Here is an example that shows how a model can extend an Entity:

```TypeScript
// Entity
class Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;

  constructor(id: number, name: string, price: number) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }
}

// Model
class ProductModel extends Product {
  quantity: number;

  constructor(id: number, name: string, price: number, quantity: number) {
    super(id, name, price);
    this.quantity = quantity;
  }
}
```

Here is an example that shows how a model can represent a group of entities:

```TypeScript
// Model
class ProductModel {
  products: Product[];

  constructor() {
    this.products = [];
  }

  addProduct(product: Product) {
    this.products.push(product);
  }

  removeProduct(product: Product) {
    this.products = this.products.filter(p => p !== product);
  }

  getProductById(id: number) {
    return this.products.find(p => p.id === id);
  }
}
```
