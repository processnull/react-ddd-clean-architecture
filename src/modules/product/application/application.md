Application logic, is the code that implements the business rules within a specific application.

Application logic define the steps to to execute once the user interacts or send events.
Is the orchestation between the UI or Presenter and the domain Objects and logic.

Application logic is the engine that bridges the gap between business logic and the user interface: It takes the back-end business logic input and turns it into the front-end output that the user sees.

In short, the actions run with application logic have nothing to do with business, it simply outlines a series of actions triggered by an event.
