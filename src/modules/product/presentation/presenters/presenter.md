**Interactions between presenter and state:**

- The presenter can still trigger actions that initiate state updates. It can:
  - Dispatch actions in a central state management solution like Redux.
  - Call functions provided by the view layer that directly update state using hooks or Context API.
  - Pass updated data to view components, which then handle state updates internally.
